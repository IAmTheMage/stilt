The UFJF competition team, Rinobot, has developed the Stilt communication library, utilizing MQTT technology and the C++11 programming language. This library was created to enhance and streamline communication interactions, providing an efficient and robust approach to data exchange. Through the use of the MQTT protocol, Stilt offers reliable, low-latency communication, catering to the demands of applications developed by the Rinobot team. Furthermore, the choice of C++11 as the underlying programming language ensures high-quality code, leveraging modern features for effective implementation and easy maintenance.
